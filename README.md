# tokenFairy
Homework Assignment of Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Languages and System

For this assignment, I've used 3 different design patterns. 
1. Abstract Factory Pattern
2. State Pattern
3. Decorator Pattern

###### Abstract Factory Pattern
This pattern is used for creating different kinds of Token objects. In application, Token Fairy holds an array of different
kind of Factories for token generation.
###### State Pattern
Students may have different kind of states and their behavior changes according to their states. 
###### Decorator Pattern
This pattern does not fit here well but we're expected to use it. This pattern is used for adding extra items on the animation.
